# CardioSeg-Automated-Echocardiogram-Abnormality-Detection

Echocardiography, a non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used for the assessment of cardiac structure and function. It provides real-time visualization of the heart's anatomy and motion, enabling the detection of various cardiac abnormalities such as valvular defects, myocardial infarctions, cardiomyopathies, and congenital heart diseases.
To address these challenges, the objective is to develop an automated deep learning-based model that processes echocardiogram videos and outputs annotated videos highlighting regions of cardiac abnormalities through precise segmentation. This tool aims to assist clinicians by:
  .Enhancing diagnostic accuracy and consistency.
  .Reducing the time required for echocardiogram analysis.
  .Providing a scalable solution to support healthcare systems with limited specialized personnel.
  
Following is the sample input and output figures of the frames of the videos.
